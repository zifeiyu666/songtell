## Overview

SendTheSong is built with Next.js 16 and focuses on productizing the process of making a song for someone special. Users do not need music skills or a blank-page songwriting process. They provide relationship context, story details, occasion, mood, and the message they want to express, then the app generates a gift-ready song preview.

SendTheSong is more than a single AI audio generator. It supports a complete personalized music gift workflow:

- Capture the story, recipient, occasion, and emotional direction.
- Generate lyrics and a song preview.
- Refine lyrics, style, and creative direction.
- Unlock the full custom song.
- Create a shareable music video.
- Generate printable or collectible lyric wall art.
- Manage orders, songs, downloads, subscriptions, and credits from the user dashboard.

The product is designed for birthdays, anniversaries, weddings, holidays, long-distance relationships, family memories, thank-you gifts, memorial moments, and other occasions where a personal song can feel more meaningful than a generic gift.
