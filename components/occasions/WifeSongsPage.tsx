  },
  {
    question: "What style works for a love song for my wife?",

    question: "Is a custom song a good anniversary gift for my wife?",

  {
    question: "Can I make a song for my wife's birthday or Valentine's Day?",

  },
  {
    question: "Can I use a custom song for a first dance with my wife?",
    answer:
      "Yes. For a first dance or vow renewal, focus on how you met, a few defining moments, and the promise you want to make now. Choose a slower genre if you want room to dance and listen to the lyrics.",

  {
    question: "Can I pair the song with a playlist for my wife?",
